# wikiHow Paper List
Following much of the recent efforts of using wikiHow as a learning resource for event understanding, commonsense reasoning, summarization, etc. we are constructing a paper list of research based on wikiHow.  

TODO:  
1. Gather papers and links to code and resources.  
2. Organize by research topics.
